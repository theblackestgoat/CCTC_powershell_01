The answer is the count/number of lines that match in the file.

garviel@terra:~$ grep -E -o "(^[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}$)" numbers | wc -l   

Answer: 156   

Linux Basics Regular Expressions3. File: home/garviel/numbers

Use regular expressions to match valid IP addresses. The flag is the number of addresses.

HINT: What are the valid numerical values of each octet in an IP address?

grep -E -o "\b(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\b" numbers | wc -l

Answer: 36

Linux Basics Regular Expressions4. File: home/garviel/numbers

Use regular expressions to match patterns that look similar to a MAC Address. Flag is a count of the number of matches.

HINT: This is a loose match! Some of these results won't be true MAC addresses.

Linux Basics Permissions2. Identify the number of users with valid login shells, who can list the contents of the Bibliotheca directory.

First, determine the number of users with valid login shells
getent passwd | awk -F: '$7 != "/usr/sbin/nologin" && $7 != "/bin/false" && $7 != "/bin/true" {count++} END {print count}'
Get details of the users with valid shells
getent passwd | awk -F: '$7 != "/usr/sbin/nologin" && $7 != "/bin/false" && $7 != "/bin/true" {print}'
###
How to better understand details of the users
    Username: quixos - This is the username of the user.
    Password: x - In the /etc/passwd file, the password field usually contains a placeholder character 'x', indicating that the password is stored in the /etc/shadow file or another secure location.
    User ID (UID): 1132 - This is the unique numeric identifier assigned to the user by the system.
    Group ID (GID): 1136 - This is the group ID of the user. It indicates which group the user belongs to.
    User ID Info: - This field is usually reserved for additional user information, such as the full name or description. In this example, it is empty.
    Home Directory: /home/quixos - This is the user's home directory, where the user's personal files and configurations are typically stored.
    Login Shell: /bin/bash - This field specifies the default shell for the user. It determines the command interpreter that is used when the user logs in.

So, in summary, the user entry quixos:x:1132:1136::/home/quixos:/bin/bash represents a user named quixos with a UID of 1132, a GID of 1136, a home directory at /home/quixos, and a default login shell set to /bin/bash.

Answer: 24

Linux Processes 3. Identify all of the arguments given to the ntpd daemon (service) using ps.
Format: List all options with parameters (include numbers).
bombadil@minas-tirith:/$ ps -elf | grep ntpd
5 S ntp       1458     1  0  80   0 - 23949 -      May23 ?        00:01:00 /usr/sbin/ntpd -p /var/run/ntpd.pid -g -u 105:109
0 S bombadil 30969 21459  0  80   0 -  3179 -      19:18 pts/0    00:00:00 grep ntpd     
Answer: -p /var/run/ntpd.pid -g -u 105:109

Linux Processes 4. What is the parent process to Bombadil’s Bash process? (name of the binary, not the absolute path)
bombadil@minas-tirith:~$ ps -o ppid= -p $$
# echo $$ gives the PID of the currently running bash shell
21456
bombadil@minas-tirith:~$ ps -p 21456 -f
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
bombadil 21456 21437  0 17:04 ?        00:00:00 sshd: bombadil@pts/0
Answer: sshd

Linux Processes 5. Identify the file mapped to the fourth file descriptor (handle) of the cron process.
HINT: There might be multiple cron processes, but only one with the answer.
Flag format: /absolute/path
$ sudo lsof -c cron 
Answer: /run/chron.pid (I have no idea why this is the right answer)

Linux Processes 6. Identify the permissions that cron has on the file identified in Processes 5.
HINT: Read the man page for lsof to understand permissions.
Flag format: If more than one, list the permissions comma separated, no spaces
bombadil@minas-tirith:/run$ ls -lisa crond.pid
11244 4 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5 May 23 17:55 crond.pid  
Answer: r,w

Linux Processes 7. Identify the names of the orphan processes on the SysV system.
NOTE: Remember, orphan processes spawn and die periodically. Try monitoring the processes list with top or htop to find them.
Flag format: in alphabetical order with all non-alphabetic characters removed: Name,Name,Name,Name
HINT: Only character names!
run HTOP and look for PPID 1, get the names of the orphans
Answer: Aragorn,BruceWayne,Eowyn,Tolkien

Linux Processes 8. Locate zombie processes on the SysV system.
Identify the zombie processes' parent process.
NOTE: Remember, zombie processes only live until the parent process kills and removes them from the system’s process table. Try monitoring the processes list with top or htop to find them.
Flag format: /absolute/path
Run HTOP and look for the Z status
Check the PPID and run ps -p <PPID> -o comm=
funk
which funk
Answer: /bin/funk

Linux Processes 9. Locate the strange open port on the SysV system.
Identify the command line executable and its arguments.
Flag format: /executable/path -arguments
run netstat -tuln to look for and weird port activity (we see 1234 open)
monitor HTOP to see if anything comes up
see that someone is running netcat to open a port
get the PID and run the following to get more inforamtion about it
bombadil@minas-tirith:/proc$ ps -p 2354 -o pid,ppid,cmd,%cpu,%mem --no-headers && readlink -f /proc/2354/exe
2354     1 /bin/netcat -lp 9999         0.0  0.0 
Answer: /bin/netcat -lp 9999

Linux Process Proc Dir 1. Examine the process list to find the ssh process. Then, identify the symbolic link to the absolute path for its executable in the /proc directory.
The flag is the absolute path to the symbolic link, and the file it is linked to.
Flag format: /absolute/path,/absolute/path
Monitor HTOP and look for sshd, not the process
run
sudo ls -l /proc/<IPD>
look for the "-->" to annotate a link
Answer: /proc/2155/exe,/usr/sbin/sshd

Linux Process Proc Dir 2. Identify the file that contains udp connection information. Identify the process using port 123.
For the flag, enter:
    Process name
    File descriptor number for the udp socket
    Its permissions as shown in lsof
Flag format: name,#,permission
Figure out what is using UDP port 123
sudo lsof -i UDP:123
ntpd
sudo lsof | grep ntpd
ntpd       1458             ntp   19u     IPv4              12333      0t0        UDP 10.3.0.7:ntp 
ntpd = process name
19 = file descriptor
lsof permission = u
Answer: ntpd,19,u
